# Virus_Simulation

  This is the virus simulation. It is a program meant to simulate how a virus spreads in a population. The program is based on the SIR model, where the main variables affecting the spread of a virus or disease are population density, transmission rate and infectious period of the disease. This is an interactive simulation.

When the user runs the program, they will be prompted to question in the console. They are asked to enter the sample population, which is supposed to represent the population density, then the transmission rate between 0 and 1 (0 - 100%), infectious period and the recovery time. It is advised that the user does not enter more than 100 into the sample size, because it will start lagging. As for the infectious period represents the amount of time an infected individual can transmit the disease to others. The transmission rate meant to use to calculate the probability that a person might get infected when they come in contact with someone who is infected. The recovery time is the average amount of time that an individual take to recover from the disease or virus; in the program it is a constant set by the user.

The simulation will also create a graph to represent the population the infected and recovered individuals. The x-axis of the graph represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the population. Two lines will appear, one representing the recovered individuals, and the other infected individuals.Â The graph will continuously update throughout the simulation to portray the live development of the virus/disease.

The program represents people as circles that come in 3 colors. Black for a susceptible, i.e. a non-infected person who can get infected, red for an infected individual and green for a recovered individual. These people will be randomly moving on screen; they might appear to move off screen at first, but they eventually turn back as they reach the borders of the screen. Individuals will change their colors as they get infected and as they recover.

The user should run multiple instances of the simulation, changing the numbers they input each time to observe how these different variables affect the spread of a disease or virus.
